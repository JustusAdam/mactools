# mactools
List of (mostly free and OS) software I use on my mac as well as where and how to get it.

Refer to [tools.adoc](tools.adoc) for the list.

## What this is

This is basically a list of software-isch things that I would recommend. It started out as a list of packages I would/should reinstall in case I had to start with a fresh OS X installation (which I had to do multiple times).

Every single item on this list I have installed and used and most likely am using still. This list is also highly opinionated.

Suggestions for things I may have missed are welcome but if I don't know or approve of the tool/software I won't merge it.

Individual lists are sort-of ordered ascending by importance and opinion.

## The List

The list itself is `tools.yaml`. `tools.adoc` is generated from it using `Main.hs generate`.
